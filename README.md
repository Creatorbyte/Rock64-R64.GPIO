# Rock64-R64.GPIO
A Python GPIO library for the Rock64 single-board computer ([RPi.GPIO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-gpio-python/) clone).

## Python Libraries and Scripts

**R64.GPIO**<br>
A re-implementation of the RPi.GPIO library for the Rock64. Currently under development.<br>
See our [wiki](https://github.com/Leapo/Rock64-R64.GPIO/wiki) for documentation on [Functions](https://github.com/Leapo/Rock64-R64.GPIO/wiki/Functions) and [GPIO Modes](https://github.com/Leapo/Rock64-R64.GPIO/wiki/GPIO-Modes).

**R64-GPIO-test.py**<br>
A simple test script. Outputs a list of internal vars, sets the GPIO mode to "BOARD", sets up a GPIO output (blinks an LED if connected to pin 16), sets up a GPIO input (pulls-up and reports the state of pin 18), then cleans up all GPIO exports and exits.

## Module Installation and Usage:
**Importing R64.GPIO:**<br>
Method 1 (Reccomended):
1. Download the entire "R64" folder from the repo.
1. Place the "R64" folder in the same directory as the Python script you're working with.
1. Within your script, substitute the normal "`import RPi.GPIO as GPIO`" line for "`import R64.GPIO as GPIO`".

Method 2 (Spoofing RPi.GPIO):
1. Download the entire "R64" folder from the repo.
1. Rename the "R64" folder to "RPi"
1. Place the "RPi" folder in the same directory as the Python script you're working with.
1. Importing via "`import RPi.GPIO as GPIO`" will now work as expected.

Once imported, syntax for implemented functions should be identical to RPi.GPIO.
